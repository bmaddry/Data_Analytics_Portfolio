#Brett Maddry Project Portfolio

##About
I’m a data-driven professional with experiences spanning demand forecasting and business analytics. Over the past six years, I’ve managed forecasts and financial plans for high-volume product categories at Crate & Barrel and Abercrombie & Fitch, overseeing portfolios exceeding $150 million annually.

Currently, I'm pursuing my Masters of Business Analytics at UW-Madison to further expand and grow into the machine learning, predictive analytics, and data visualization space. In my career outside of data, I'm also passionate about leading and mentoring others, along with building collaborative cross-functional relationships.

This portfolio was built to highlight my technical skills and includes projects inside of Machine Learning, Generalized Linear Models, Pyomo Optimization, SQL, Tableau and AWS. My personal interest in sports analytics is reflected in a handful of projects, and I'm currently designing a model to generate odds for NHL regaular season games. Feel free to come back soon if you're interested!
