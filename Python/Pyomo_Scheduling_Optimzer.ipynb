        "This project focuses on finding the solution for a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem using Pyomo and CBC solver, to optimize scheduling for athletic events. This was inspired by the challenge of high school teams in Northern Wisconsin, having to travel over 100 miles for interconference play.\n",

        "Using the eight interconference teams as inputs, we have nine different constraints to ensure fairness of play. Then using the objective of minimizing travel, the model generates a schedule for each team across two seasons. This approach is also highly transferable for logistics and supply chain fleet optimization problems."
